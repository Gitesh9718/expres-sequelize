            device. This data, for example, contains the information that you made a purchase, your device ID and/or your
            username, but it does not contain any financial or otherwise sensitive information. Also, some of our mobile
            platforms might provide us with data that you authorized them to provide. Further, our mobile products might ask for
            more personal information from you, such as your contact list or precise location and push notification tokens. This
            information will only be collected if you explicitly agree to our request.</p>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify"><strong>LinkedIn Connect:</strong> We might also offer you the option of
            easier registration for our and services through Linkedin. You can use your existing Linkedin user account for this
            purpose. By clicking the "Log in with Linkedin" link, you can use this registration method via our online Linkedin.
            To do this, you need to already have a Linkedin account.<br/> If you would like to register for one of our services
            using your Linkedin account, the first step in the registration process will immediately redirect you to Linkedin.
            Linkedin will then ask you to log in or to register. Under no circumstances will we receive your personal access
            data (user name and password).<br/> In a second step, you will connect your Linkedin profile with the service for
            which you would like to register. At this point, you will be told what data from your Linkedin profile will be
            transmitted to us. This information is usually your &ldquo;public information&rdquo; on Linkedin and information
            which you have made available to the public or authorized for the application in question. Information of this type
            generally includes your name, profile picture and cover photo, your gender, your networks, your username (Linkedin
            URL), and your user ID number (Linkedin ID). We will also use the email address you have saved with Linkedin in
            order to contact you outside of Linkedin. You can see an overview of information in your profile that is available
            to the public via the General Account Settings menu of your Linkedin profile.</p>

            (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and where we have a justified interest to do so (Art. 6(1)(f)). For instance, we resort to our

        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">We do not share any personal data that directly identifies you (e.g.
            postal address, e-mail, your name) with third parties for their own us without your consent. Exceptions are if we
            determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights, operations or property or there is a
            requirement by law or to protect our users or third parties. We may share anonymous or aggregated information or
            other information, which cannot be used to directly identify you, with third parties.</p>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">To collect and process personal information on our behalf for different
            reasons, such as facilitating credit card processing, sending emails or conducting market surveys, we employ third
            parties in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Union). In case third party
            agents or service providers collect or receive personal data, we require them to use the information exclusively on
            our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy. Further, we do not knowingly disclose personal data
            concerning children under 18 years of age to independent third parties, even with a consent. Nevertheless, in case
            of a divestiture merger, sale, bankruptcy or reorganisation, we might transmit all information we collect to the
            respective third party, while obtaining your consent to do so, if required by law. Moreover, we do not control
            information sent from your browser to third parties such as analytics companies and advertising networks that
            receive data in the course of your normal Internet usage. When third party social tools or technologies are part of
            our products, the responsible third parties may collect data when you use our products. For instance, the LINKEDIN
            "Like" button.</p>

            advertising such as links to third party websites. You will leave the Meoh application and go to the site you
            selected, if you click on one of those links, including advertisement. In case you use a third party service or go
            to a third party website, you should be aware of that service's or site's privacy policy.</p>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and

            Apple, Google, Microsoft, BlackBerry, or any other company, social media platform providers, operating system

        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">It is of utmost importance to Meoh to protect children&rsquo;s privacy
            online. By children we mean individuals under the age of 13 or the minimum age in the respective territory if that
            age is older than 13. Please be aware that if you give consent for your child to use MEOH&rsquo;s mobile services
            and products, this may include general audience communication services such as instant messaging, online groups and
            email, where your child will be able to communicate with and disclose personal information to other users of all
            ages. If as a parent you wish to revoke a previously provided consent, review information collected from your child
            or have this information deleted, contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator at Meoh ASBL, 4 Rue du Pays
            de Liege, 1000 Brussels, Belgium or via <a href="https://www.meoh.io/contact">https://www.meoh.io/contact</a>.</p>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">Collected information is processed and stored in a manner consistent
            with this Privacy and Cookie Policy. We will notify by in-game notice or by email to receive verifiable consent from
            them, if we make changes to how we collect, use or share their child's personal data. Nevertheless, we encourage
            parents to talk with their children about disclosing personal information online and communicating with
            strangers.</p>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify"><a name="_44sinio"></a> Under no circumstances do we condition a child's
            participation in activities such as contests on its disclosure of more personal data than is necessary to take part
            in the activities. We may not grant children the permission to participate at all on certain sites regardless of
            consent.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE">MEOH might uses Cloud Services from Google or other Cloud service providers in the
            future. In terms of data protection, cloud computing means the processing of personal data on behalf of the MEOH as
            cloud user through the cloud provider. The GDPR (Article 28) requires that the cloud user only chooses cloud
            providers that provide reasonable guarantees for proper technical and organizational measures. Google complies with
            data processing and security conditions and act for us as a processor of personal data under the GDPR. Google
            provides its clients with updated contract terms in accordance with the new requirements of the GDPR.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">We provide you with meaningful choices concerning important uses and
            collection of information. If you choose to opt out any time after you have given your consent, contact the
            appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator at Meoh ASBL, 4 Rue du Pays de Liege, 1000 Brussels, Belgium or via <a

        <p class="western" lang="de-DE" align="justify">Most of your preferences can be reviewed and modified using your MEOH
            account settings. In those cases where we need a consent to collect and use data concerning you, this consent can be
            withdrawn any time by you. You can delete personal data associated with your MEOH account or deactivate your MEOH
            account. By doing so, you will lose access to MEOH services associated with your account. Be aware that MEOH may
            keep data needed to enforce our user agreements, comply with legal and technical requirements, resolve disputes,
            protect our legal rights and comply with constraints related to security, operation and integrity of our products.
            In any other case, we will keep your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to create and improve our
            products, run our business, provide you services and comply with the law.</p>

            guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for
